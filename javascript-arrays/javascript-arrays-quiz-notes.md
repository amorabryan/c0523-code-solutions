- How are arrays different from "plain" objects?
  Arrays are different than objects because they use numbers to access the 'elements' instead of using properties.

  0

- What is the `length` property of an array?
  The 'length' property identifies the number of values in the array or the total count of the elements in the array.

  array.length - 1 to access the last index by element number or array[array.length - 1] to access the value stored in the last index.
