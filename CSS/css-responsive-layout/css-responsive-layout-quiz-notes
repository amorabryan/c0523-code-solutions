## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
A breakpoint in responsive Web design is where a website's content and design will adapt for the user.


- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
px is a static measurement, meaning it will stay wherever the user has placed it. Percentage is scalar, so it will scale to the relative parent object.


- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
Specificity and by CSS design. If you apply two rules that collide to the same elements, CSS will choose the last one that was declared unless a higher specificity takes place.
