## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a "callback" function?
  Its a function passed into another function as an argument, which executes inside the outer function to complete a routine or action.

- Besides adding an event listener callback function to an element or the `document`, what is one way to delay the execution of a JavaScript function until some point in the future?
  By using setInterval() and setTimeout() methods.

- How can you set up a function to be called repeatedly without using a loop?
  You can use the setInterval() function to call a function and the delay between those functions.

- What is the default time delay if you omit the `delay` parameter from `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()`?
  0, meaning it will execute immediately, or the next event cycle.

- What do `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` return?
  setTimeout() returns timeoutID, which is a positive integer value that identifies the timer created by the call to setTimeout().
  setInterval() returns timeoutID, which is a numeric, non-zero value that identifies the timer created by the call to setInterval().
