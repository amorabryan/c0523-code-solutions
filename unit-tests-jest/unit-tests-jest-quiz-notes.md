## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are unit tests?
  They are small tests that check if individual parts of a program, like functions or classes, work correctly on their own.

- Why is it important to write unit tests?
  They help find mistakes early, make it safer to change code, improve the overall quality of the code, and serve as living instructions for how code should be used.

- What code should be tested with a unit test? What code is not well suited for unit tests?
  They are good for testing small parts of code, like functions or classes, that work independently. Code that depends a lot on other things, like databases or APIs, might not be suitable for unit tests.

- What is Jest? What are some other popular JavaScript unit testing frameworks?
  Jest is a popular testing tool for JavaScript code, often used with React applications. Other common testing tools include Mocha, Chai, and Jasmine.
