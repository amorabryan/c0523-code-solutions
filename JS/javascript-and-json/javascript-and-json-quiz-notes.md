- What is JSON?
  JSON is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JS object syntax. It resembles JS object literal syntax and exists as a string.

- What are serialization and deserialization?
  Serialization: the process of turning an object in memory into a stream of bytes that can be sent over the network
  Deserialization: turning a stream of bytes into an object in memory

- Why are serialization and deserialization useful?
  They are extremely useful because they allow objects to be easily stored and transmitted between different systems. They're used in various scenarios, such as storing objects in a database, sending objects over a network, or caching objects in memory. It enables us to keep data for use in running processes or other processes if needed.
